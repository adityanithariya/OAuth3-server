# OAuth3
Government Document Authorization Protocol using Blockchain

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
yarn start   # yarn hardhat node
yarn test    # yarn hardhat test
yarn deploy  # yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
yarn compile # yarn hardhat compile
yarn help    # yarn hardhat help
REPORT_GAS=true yarn test
```
